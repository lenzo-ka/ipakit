"""What ``compose_unit`` must satisfy: it answers the question, or nothing.

The defect this file exists for was silent in the way ``docs/reviewing.md``
describes. ``compose_unit`` spells a change by appending the mark that
*declares* the wanted value, then verifies by reading the result back and
checking the keys it was asked for. Those keys were right and the answer
was still wrong: ``compose_unit("s", place="bilabial")`` was ``"s̼"``, the
linguolabial fricative, because the linguolabial mark genuinely declares
``place="bilabial"`` and also, independently, ``articulator="tongue-tip"``.
A caller asking for one dimension got two moved, and the self-check could
not see it because it never looked at the dimensions it had not asked
about. Reachable from a rule: ``respell`` cannot spell that change either,
so ``Action`` falls through to here.

The obvious repair is wrong, and is pinned below so it cannot be
reintroduced. Refusing any mark that declares more than was asked also
refuses the devoicing ring, which declares ``phonation="devoiced"`` *and*
``voiced="-"`` -- so ``ɹ̥`` and ``l̥`` stop composing and approximant
devoicing stops firing at all. Those are not two facts. ``voiced`` is the
glottal state read two ways where ``phonation`` reads it four, and
``<projections>`` in ``ipa.xml`` is where the data says so.

So the tests here are about the *distinction*, swept rather than sampled:
every registered phone crossed with every ``(feature, value)`` any
diacritic declares, with each outcome classified by comparing the whole
before and after bundle rather than the requested keys. 8062 cells today,
and the count is derived from the inventory so it cannot go quietly
vacuous.
